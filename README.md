# Numeric-Expression-Calculator-in-JS
This js app calculates simple numeric expressions.
It just reads the input from clicking the key buttons of the calculator and calculates with eval().
The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument.

DANGER!!!
Here, eval method is safe to run, because the input is just numbers!
BUT >>>
With eval(): 
1.malicious code can run inside your application without permission.
2.third-party code can see the scope of your application, which can lead to possible attacks.
